        <h3>Fitt: Scrappy Sun Devils Keep Finding A Way</h3>

        <p>
          As Pacific-12 Conference play begins this weekend, perhaps the most fascinating series in the West Coast pits Arizona State against league favorite Oregon State in Corvallis. At 12-2, the Beavers appear to be exactly who we thought they were — a bona fide national title contender. Oregon State is one of the best offensive teams in the country (ranking seventh nationally in batting and 14th in slugging), and its pitching and defense look solid, though this OSU staff isn’t as overpowering as many of staff in the program’s recent history.
        </p>

        <p>
          But what to make of Arizona State? This weekend will tell us a lot about the Sun Devils, who have managed to get out to a 13-3 start despite playing most of the first month without their projected ace (Hever Bueno, forearm strain) and projected closer (Andrew Shaps, who is playing center field but hasn’t been pitching due to elbow tenderness).
        </p>

        <p>
          “We’re finding ways to win,” ASU coach Tracy Smith said. “We’re thin, we kind of knew that going into this season. Then when you’re smacked with being without Bueno, then the guy you expected to be your closer, Andrew Shaps — to be 13-3 without those guys is a credit to other guys stepping up.”
        </p>

        <p>
          “I think he’s becoming a better hitter. He’s always been real steady defensively, he’s starting to hit at a high level,” Smith said. “People always asked, ‘Will he hit?’ He’s starting to make a believer out of me. He’s gotten stronger, for one. He’s just really trusting, staying back and not trying to pull everything. If guys are trying to get him away, before he would jump and regardless of what they were trying to do, try to pull everything. Now he has a better approach and that’s helped him a lot.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Like Woodmansee, first baseman David Greer was a very solid offensive player last year, but he’s taken a big step forward as a junior. Greer leads the team in batting at .415, teaming with Woodmansee to give ASU a very dangerous duo in the heart of the order.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Greer has just a very simple approach that you wish everybody had, but he’s stronger now, driving balls to the gaps,” Smith said. He’s just a really, really good hitter.”

        <div class="clearfix"></div>

        <p>
          Serven hasn’t made as much noise with his bat but has provided solid offensive production, hitting .286/.338/.381. But he really stands out for his defense behind the plate, where he has controlled opposing running games with remarkable proficiency. Serven has thrown out 13 of 24 basestealers (64 percent).
        </p>

        <p>
          “We rolled in there in that Fullerton series, I don’t know that they attempted to steal a base,” Smith said. “But he’s been throwing everybody out … You just don’t see the premium catchers like that — he’s kind of the whole deal. He swings the bat too. He’s bigger and stronger, and I think he’ll be very appealing to some (pro) organization.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Until Shaps returns to the mound, junior righthander Eder Erives (2-0, 2.60 in 17.1 IP over seven appearances) is the clear anchor of the bullpen. Smith said because the Sun Devils have had to lean on him more heavily than they’d like, his stuff hasn’t always been as electric as it can be, but he’s competed with his 88-91 fastball and good slider, and shown the ability to throw multiple pitches for strikes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bueno has a chance to be really good too, if he can get healthy. Smith said the righthander sat 95-97 mph with three good pitches on opening night before his injury. He’s back to throwing off a mound, and he’ll likely get another bullpen session after this weekend, but the Sun Devils didn’t want to break him back in on the road in a hostile conference setting.
